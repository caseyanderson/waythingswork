### MacOS

1. plug your `ESP32` into your Laptopâ€™s USB port
2. (in the Finder) Navigate to Applications > Utilities
3. find the Terminal, open it
4. (in the Terminal) activate your `micropython` environment: `conda activate micropython`
5. navigate to wherever the file is on your computer
6. type the following: `ampy -p /dev/tty.`
7. hit the TAB key, one of the results should be: `tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`
8. add an `SL` to the command above so it reads: `ampy -p /dev/tty.SL`
9. hit the TAB key again, autocomplete should give you: `ampy -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`
10. add `put` to the end of the command above: `ampy -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART put`
11. type and use autocomplete to add the name of the file that you want to `put` on the `ESP32`: `ampy -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART put blink.py`
12. hit Enter

### Windows 10

1. (in the Start Menu) Navigate to Anaconda Powershell, open it
2. check the list of identified `COM` ports in the Windows Device Manager
  * we need the `COM` number for the device labeled `Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM3)`, write this number down for use later
3. (in the Anaconda Powershell) activate your `micropython` environment: `conda activate micropython`
4. navigate to wherever the file is on your computer
5. type the following: `ampy --port COM3` (use the COM number from step 2)
6. add `put` to the end of the command above: `ampy --port COM3 put`
7. type and use autocomplete to add the name of the file that you want to `put` on the `ESP32`: `ampy --port COM3 put blink.py`
