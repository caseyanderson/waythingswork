## brief

Create an interactive prototype using only one button as an input and two LEDs as outputs, where interacting with the button switches which LED is on. The button must be made of paper / cardboard and conductive tape and designed by you. Your challenge is to design the button such that it is "hidden" in your prototype (i.e. it should not look like a conventional button nor should interacting with it feel like interacting with a push-button).

### requirements

* target platform: ESP32
* has two possible outputs (LEDs)
* allows audience/user to control outputs
* prompts or rewards audience/user interaction
* uses one disguised / hidden / DIY button
* document final deployment, present to class as a video
