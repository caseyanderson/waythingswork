## brief

Combine / remix a technological feature developed for your first prototype with a technological feature developed for your second prototype in order to create a new (third) prototype. While the specifics are up to you, your remixed prototype should prompt an audience member/user to interact with two sensors in order to control/change two unique outputs.

### requirements

* target platform: ESP32
* has two unique inputs (at least one must be an analog sensor)
* has two unique outputs (printing to the console does not count as an output this time)
* prompts or rewards audience/user interaction (sensor input results in a significant change/output)
* significantly makes use of technology you developed from both of your previous prototypes to produce something new
* relationship between the sensors, and the interactions associated with each, fits into the larger context of the prototype
* document final deployment, present to class as a video
