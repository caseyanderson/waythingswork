## brief

Create a prototype in which an audience member/user is prompted to interact with at least two sensors in order to control/change at least two possible outputs. While the specifics are up to you one general goal for this project is to create a context/story that incentivizes interaction with your prototype.


### requirements

* target platform: ESP32
* has at least two inputs (at least one must be an analog sensor)
* has at least two outputs (at least one must use a TIP120)
* prompts or rewards audience/user interaction (sensor input results in a significant change/output)
* relationship between the sensors, and the interactions associated with each, fits into the larger context of the prototype
* document final deployment, present to class as a video
