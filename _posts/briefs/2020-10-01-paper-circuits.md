## brief

Create a prototype in which a person is prompted to interact with 2 paper buttons / embedded buttons in order to control four possible LEDs. While the specifics are up to you one general goal for this project is to create a context/story that incentivizes interaction with your prototype.


### requirements

* target platform: ESP32
* uses at least two unique, original designs for buttons constructed out of paper / cardboard and copper tape (at a minimum: one momentary and one toggle)
* uses at least four embedded / disguised LEDs as outputs
* prompts or rewards audience/user interaction
* prototype is fully-enclosed (no breadboard or wires visible)
* document final version via video demo, present to class as a video
